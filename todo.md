log in and sign up work
book search works
can view the favorite books
can view the book reviews
search works (I messed up the front end search.js so I retyped the javascript again took 2 hours)
add a review button goes to another addReview.handlebars page
add to Favorites button goes to another addFav.handlebars page

need reviews 1.add a review 2.edit a review 3.delete a review
need favs 1.add to favs 2.remove from favs
logout button works inconsistently depending on what handlebar page the user is on
the back button does not cache the previous page I must research how to do this


Then I will deploy to render.com
