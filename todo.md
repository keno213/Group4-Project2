book search works

can view the book reviews
search works (I messed up the front end search.js so I retyped the javascript again took 2 hours)
add a review button goes to another addReview.handlebars page
add to Favorites button goes to another addFav.handlebars page

need reviews 1.add a review 2.edit a review 3.delete a review
need favs 1.add to favs 2.remove from favs
logout button works inconsistently depending on what handlebar page the user is on

the back button does not cache the previous page I must research how to do this
Here is what I found
When using Handlebars in a web app, the browser back button typically causes data loss on previous pages because the browser is simply reloading the page from cache, which doesn't retain the dynamic data generated by Handlebars on the client-side; to address this, you need to implement a mechanism to store and restore the data using JavaScript, either through local storage or by managing the state on the server-side when navigating back.

Then I will deploy to render.com
